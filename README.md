## How to enable sv_cheats?
You can set sv_cheats to 1 on the server, but clients will receive a message saying "[Server] Cheats cannot be enabled on this server," unless they launch the game with the -dev option. 

If launched with -dev, clients will see the message "[Developer] SetConVar: sv_cheats = "true"," and the server will allow cheats like the "give" command to be used. 

However, the client will still believe that sv_cheats is set to 0.

Thanks to domino_ mod36#3456 for this.
